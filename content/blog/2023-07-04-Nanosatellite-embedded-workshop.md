What better and fun way to learn something new, than learning by doing.
We've decided to showcase what Rust is cable of by creating an embedded workshop
with a few goals in mind that we want to share in this blog post...

## Space Conference - Plovdiv

AeroRust's workshop will take place in the second day of the 2-day conference which will take place on
3rd and 4th of June in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

The participants slots for the workshop are limited and if you plan to visit Plovdiv, this is the perfect opportunity
to meet people interested in space and have fun building your own Nanosatellite subsystem.

The conference is organised in collaboration with [Space Generation Advisory Council](https://spacegeneration.org) -
an organisation providing young professionals and students interested in the space industry with
all kinds of opportunities.

As a National Point of Contact for Bulgaria of SGAC, I'm very excited to bring as much young people to this event
and spark interest in a new space generation.
Something that has been missing for some time in Bulgaria and will be
the key for our future development as country.

### Conclusion

#### Roadmap 2023

As some of you remember, preparations for this workshop began [in December as part of the community's 2023 Roadmap](@/blog/2023-01-02-AeroRust-3-years-birthday.md#embedded-cubesat-workshop).

Our goals since the beginning have been to make it accessible and affordable to allow for the workshop to be organised in other locations.

As a community working on open-source tooling and resources, we will not miss out on the chance to open source
all the materials for this workshop.
