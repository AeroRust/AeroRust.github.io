<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In the field of youth policy, Great Britain is recognised as one of the pioneers of the modern understanding of student self-governance. It is therefore not surprising that active student participation plays a key role in Higher Education, even in the field of aerospace engineering. This presentation aims to first familiarise the audience with the differences in the educational strategy in STEM of the United Kingdom and those of Bulgaria and most countries in Europe - how capacity is quickly built, what are the topics and areas on which education in the field of aerospace technologies focuses, how it is taught, how universities collaborate. The key role of student groups and communities is then analysed from two major aspects. On the one hand, how the participation dictates the development of education as a whole, and on the other - the impact of student groups and societies on personal and professional development of the students. Suggestions are made on how to develop and nurture such communities.</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Dimitar Ferdinandov is a recent masters graduate in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Birmingham and is active in the field of education, including in his capacity as a Bulgarian Youth Delegate to the Council of the EU and a co-founder of an educational technology start up, developing educational tools in the field of engineering. As a president of the University of Birmingham Space Society he has worked on ensuring students with wider academic background gain hands-on experience in the field of space and has enabled and worked on interuniversity engineering projects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Микрокосмос и Вселена. Ние сме една извънредно малка частица от необятната Вселената и при това твърде отдалечени и от микрокосмоса. Мащабът е огромен, но желанието ни да разберем каква е връзката между тях е съвсем естествено. Нашите познания се градят на наблюдения и експерименти в различни области, но между тях има огромни празнини. При опита да се запълнят липсващите звена се създават хипотези и теории, но доказателствата дали те са верни е под въпрос. Един от най-сигурните критерии за достоверност е липса на противоречие с човешката логика. Съвременната ни представи за микрокосмоса и Вселената обаче не издържат на този критерий.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are transforming global connectivity by integrating satellites and high-altitude platforms with terrestrial networks. This presentation outlines the goals, intriguing technological aspects, challenges, and current NTN deployments under 3GPP standards like 5G.</p>
<p>Objectives: NTN aims to extend internet and communication services to remote and underserved areas, including rural regions, oceans, and disaster zones. By doing so, NTN helps bridge the digital divide, providing access to vital communication services for all.</p>
<p>Technology Overview: The NTN 3GPP standard proposes using advanced technologies onboard satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) such as balloons and drones that provide coverage from the stratosphere. These technologies enable NTN to offer reliable, high-speed internet even in the harshest conditions. Importantly, NTN aims to use standard terminals without modification.</p>
<p>Challenges: NTN faces challenges such as regulatory issues, the high cost of deploying and maintaining satellite constellations, and ensuring seamless interoperability between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks.</p>
<p>Current Deployments: Several companies have developed or are in the process of developing NTNs that comply with 3GPP standards.</p>
<p>Interesting Facts and Statistics:
NTN can cover more than 90% of the Earth’s surface, including oceans and polar regions.
The satellite communications market is expected to reach $53.7 billion by 2027.
HAPs used in NTN can stay in the air for months, powered by solar energy.</p>
<p>In summary, NTN under 3GPP represents a groundbreaking approach to achieving global connectivity, changing how we connect with each other no matter where we are.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This talk provides a brief introduction to how I built the "hello world" of avionics: an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We will explore basic concepts, including how to connect various sensors to a microcontroller, develop firmware using Rust's Embassy framework, and implement basic sensor fusion by combining gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer readings into a single output. Although this project is an introductory example, we will also discuss potential improvements to adapt it for real-world aerospace applications.</p>

<p>After discussion with the other co-organizers, we decided to postpone the conference from June 8 (Saturday) to  28 September (Saturday). The reasons are unforeseen circumstances with some of the presenters and almost all the students we aimed to attract to the conference will be at another event on the same day. We sincerely apologize for the late decision, but our priority remains the quality of the conference and the people who will subsequently meet at it. We hope to see you then!</p>
