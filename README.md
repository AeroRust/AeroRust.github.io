### Development

#### Run `Zola`

You need to [install `zola`](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) (a static site generator).

Run in your terminal:

```bash
zola serve
```

#### Run `npm`
For the front-end part (scss, javascript) you need `npm` & `webpack`.

Run in a separate terminal window:

```bash
npm run dev
```
